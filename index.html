	  <p style="color:#003333">Information technology has changed how we see the world. The major role IT teams play in today’s business world is in help desk support and other customer support services. Service is often provided by groups for businesses that offer these jobs as they’re required, and therefore the business is way bigger overall than it absolutely was 20 years ago. Computers are becoming gradually important as more people have mobile devices and rely on the Internet for shopping, entertainment and business. The trend has given rise to many software developers and web designers.</p><br><br>

<p style="color:#003333">Technology changing the workplace and society has both good and bad aspects. Its most negative is probably the fact that employees are always supposed to be online, cutting into their rest and leisure time. Worker distraction is another issue. With some fluctuations to people’s acuity of what technology can be used for, the workplace could be greatly benefited by new software and hardware. If businesses are made aware that new technology does not automatically mean that employees are available all the time, and that privacy rights must be protected, businesses will achieve a massive amount in the couple of years with new workplace technology.For more information <a href="https://www.dips.x10host.com">Impact of IT</a></p>
